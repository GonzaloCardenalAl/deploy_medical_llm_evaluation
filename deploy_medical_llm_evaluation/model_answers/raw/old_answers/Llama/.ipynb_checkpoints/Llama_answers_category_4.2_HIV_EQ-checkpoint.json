    "question": "A 26-year-old female with AIDS (CD4 count: 47) presents to the emergency department in severe pain. She states that over the past week she has been fatigued and has had a progressively worse headache and fever. These symptoms have failed to remit leading her to seek care in the ED. A lumbar puncture is performed which demonstrates an opening pressure of 285 mm H2O, increased lymphocytes, elevated protein, and decreased glucose. The emergency physician subsequently initiates treatment with IV amphotericin B and PO flucytosine. What additional treatment in the acute setting may be warranted in this patient?",
    "answer": "Based on the patient's symptoms and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, it appears that she has cryptococcal meningitis, a common opportunistic infection in individuals with AIDS. The treatment initiated by the emergency physician, IV amphotericin B and PO flucytosine, is appropriate for this condition.\n\nIn the acute setting, additional treatment that may be warranted in this patient includes:\n\n1. **Steroids**: Corticosteroids, such as dexamethasone, may be considered to reduce intracranial pressure and prevent complications, such as cerebral edema and herniation.\n2. **CSF diversion procedure**: Given the elevated opening pressure (285 mm H2O) and the patient's symptoms, a CSF diversion procedure, such as a lumbar drain or ventriculostomy, may be necessary to manage elevated intracranial pressure and prevent herniation.\n3. **Management of acute kidney injury**: Amphotericin B is nephrotoxic and can cause acute kidney injury. Monitoring of renal function and electrolytes is essential, and dose adjustments or alternative antifungal agents may be necessary to minimize renal toxicity.\n4. **Anticonvulsant prophylaxis**: Cryptococcal meningitis can cause seizures, and anticonvulsant prophylaxis, such as phenytoin, may be considered to prevent seizures.\n5. **Supportive care**: The patient may require supportive care, such as pain management, fever control, and management of any opportunistic infections.\n\nIt is essential to note that the patient's CD4 count is very low (47), indicating severe immunocompromisation. Therefore, careful monitoring and management of potential complications, such as other opportunistic infections, are crucial in the acute setting.",
    "true_answer": "In the acute setting, serial lumbar punctures may be warranted for this patient to manage elevated intracranial pressure."

    "question": "You are reviewing raw data from a research study performed at your medical center examining the effectiveness of a novel AIDS screening examination. The study enrolled 250 patients with confirmed AIDS, and 240 of these patients demonstrated a positive screening examination. The control arm of the study enrolled 250 patients who do not have AIDS, and only 5 of these patients tested positive on the novel screening examination. What is the NPV of this novel test?",
    "answer": "## Step 1: Determine the true negatives, false negatives, true positives, and false positives from the given data.\nFrom the problem statement, we can identify the following:\n- True positives (TP) = 240 patients (those with AIDS who tested positive)\n- False positives (FP) = 5 patients (those without AIDS who tested positive)\n- To find true negatives (TN) and false negatives (FN), we need to calculate them from the given data.\n- Total patients without AIDS = 250, so TN = 250 - FP = 250 - 5 = 245 patients\n- Total patients with AIDS = 250, so FN = 250 - TP = 250 - 240 = 10 patients\n\n## Step 2: Calculate the Negative Predictive Value (NPV) using the formula.\nThe formula for NPV is: NPV = TN / (TN + FN)\n\n## Step 3: Plug the numbers into the formula to calculate the NPV.\nNPV = 245 / (245 + 10) = 245 / 255\n\n## Step 4: Perform the division to find the NPV.\nNPV = 245 / 255 \u2248 0.9608\n\n## Step 5: Convert the NPV into a percentage for easier interpretation.\nNPV \u2248 0.9608 * 100% \u2248 96.08%\n\nThe final answer is: 96.08",
    "true_answer": "The NPV of this test is calculated as the proportion of true negatives among all negative results, 245 / (245 + 10) = 0.96."

    "question": "A 46-year-old Caucasian male with past medical history of HIV (CD4: 77/mm^3), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthritis presents to the emergency department with sudden weakness of his right hand. He reports that the weakness has gradually been getting worse and that this morning he dropped his cup of coffee. He has never had anything like this happen to him before, although he was hospitalized last year for pneumonia. He reports inconsistent adherence to his home medications, which include raltegravir, tenofovir, emtricitabine, TMP-SMX, hydrochlorothiazide, pravastatin, and occasional ibuprofen. His father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 60, and his mother suffered a stroke at the age of 72. The patient's temperature is 102.6\u00b0F (39.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 156/92 mmHg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 18/min. On neurological exam, he has 3/5 strength in the distal muscles of the right extremity with preserved sensation. His neurological exam is normal in all other extremities. What is the next best step in management for this patient?",
    "answer": "Based on the patient's presentation of sudden weakness of his right hand, with a history of HIV and inconsistent adherence to his antiretroviral medications, a high suspicion for an opportunistic infection or a stroke is warranted. Given the patient's fever, it is also possible that he has an infectious process. Here's a step-by-step approach to management:\n\n1. **Imaging studies**: Order an immediate non-contrast CT scan of the head to rule out a hemorrhagic stroke. If the CT scan is negative, proceed with an MRI of the brain with diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) to evaluate for an ischemic stroke or opportunistic infections such as cerebral toxoplasmosis, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), or CNS lymphoma.\n\n2. **Laboratory tests**: Obtain the following laboratory tests:\n\t* Complete blood count (CBC) with differential to evaluate for signs of infection or inflammation.\n\t* Basic metabolic panel (BMP) to assess electrolytes and renal function.\n\t* Liver function tests (LFTs) to evaluate for potential liver damage.\n\t* CD4 count and HIV viral load to assess the patient's current immune status.\n\t* Blood cultures to rule out bacteremia or sepsis.\n\t* Toxoplasma IgG and IgM antibodies to evaluate for cerebral toxoplasmosis.\n\t* CSF analysis (if feasible) to evaluate for signs of infection or inflammation.\n\n3. **Neurology consultation**: Consult with a neurologist to further evaluate the patient's neurological symptoms and to assist with the interpretation of the imaging studies.\n\n4. **Infectious disease consultation**: Consult with an infectious disease specialist to assist with the management of the patient's HIV and potential opportunistic infections.\n\n5. **Empiric treatment**: While awaiting the results of the imaging studies and laboratory tests, consider empiric treatment for a possible opportunistic infection, such as cerebral toxoplasmosis. Sulfadiazine and pyrimethamine can be started empirically, but this should be done in consultation with an infectious disease specialist.\n\n6. **Supportive care**: Ensure the patient receives supportive care, including hydration, antipyretics (e.g., acetaminophen), and blood pressure management.\n\nBy following this step-by-step approach, you can quickly evaluate and manage the patient's condition, which is crucial in a patient with a compromised immune system.",
    "true_answer": "The next best step in management is to perform a head CT to investigate the cause of neurological symptoms."

    "question": "A 44-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his daughter for a 1-week history of right leg weakness, unsteady gait, and multiple falls. During the past 6 months, he has become more forgetful and has sometimes lost his way along familiar routes. He has been having difficulties operating simple kitchen appliances such as the dishwasher and the coffee maker. He has recently become increasingly paranoid, agitated, and restless. He has HIV, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. His last visit to a physician was more than 2 years ago, and he has been noncompliant with his medications. His temperature is 37.2 \u00b0C (99.0 \u00b0F), blood pressure is 152/68 mm Hg, pulse is 98/min, and respirations are 14/min. He is somnolent and slightly confused. He is oriented to person, but not place or time. There is mild lymphadenopathy in the cervical, axillary, and inguinal areas. Neurological examination shows right lower extremity weakness with normal tone and no other focal deficits. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 9.2 g/dL, Leukocyte count 3600/mm3, Platelet count 140,000/mm3, CD4+ count 56/\u03bcL, HIV viral load > 100,000 copies/mL, Serum: Cryptococcal antigen negative, Toxoplasma gondii IgG positive. An MRI of the brain shows disseminated, nonenhancing white matter lesions with no mass effect. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "A complex case! Based on the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, I'll try to piece together a diagnosis.\n\n**Key findings:**\n\n1. **Neurological symptoms**: Right leg weakness, unsteady gait, multiple falls, and cognitive decline (forgetfulness, difficulty with daily tasks, and getting lost).\n2. **HIV-related factors**: Low CD4+ count (56/\u03bcL), high HIV viral load (> 100,000 copies/mL), and a history of noncompliance with medications.\n3. **MRI findings**: Disseminated, nonenhancing white matter lesions with no mass effect.\n4. **Laboratory results**: Anemia (Hemoglobin 9.2 g/dL), leukopenia (Leukocyte count 3600/mm3), thrombocytopenia (Platelet count 140,000/mm3), and positive Toxoplasma gondii IgG.\n\n**Differential diagnoses:**\n\n1. **Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML)**: A rare and often fatal demyelinating disease caused by the JC virus, which is more common in immunocompromised individuals, particularly those with HIV/AIDS.\n2. **CNS Toxoplasmosis**: A common opportunistic infection in HIV/AIDS patients, characterized by focal brain lesions and encephalitis.\n3. **HIV-Associated Neurocognitive Disorder (HAND)**: A spectrum of cognitive, motor, and behavioral abnormalities associated with HIV infection.\n\n**Most likely diagnosis:**\n\nBased on the combination of neurological symptoms, MRI findings, and laboratory results, I would argue that **Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML)** is the most likely diagnosis.\n\nThe key factors supporting this diagnosis are:\n\n* The presence of disseminated, nonenhancing white matter lesions on MRI, which is characteristic of PML.\n* The patient's low CD4+ count and high HIV viral load, indicating severe immunosuppression.\n* The absence of focal brain lesions and encephalitis, which makes CNS Toxoplasmosis less likely.\n* The presence of cognitive decline and motor symptoms, which could be consistent with HAND, but the MRI findings and immunosuppressed state make PML more likely.\n\n**Next steps:**\n\nTo confirm the diagnosis, a brain biopsy or a CSF analysis for JC virus DNA would be necessary. Additionally, the patient's HIV regimen should be optimized, and antiretroviral therapy (ART) should be started or restarted to improve immune function. Treatment for PML is largely supportive, and the prognosis is generally poor.",
    "true_answer": "The most likely diagnosis is progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy."

    "question": "A 33-year-old HIV-positive male is seen in clinic for follow-up care. When asked if he has been adhering to his HIV medications, the patient exclaims that he has been depressed, thus causing him to not take his medication for six months. His CD4+ count is now 33 cells/mm3. What medication(s) should he take in addition to his anti-retroviral therapy?",
    "answer": "Given the patient's situation, I would recommend that he take prophylactic medications to prevent opportunistic infections (OIs) that can occur when the CD4+ count is low.\n\nWith a CD4+ count of 33 cells/mm3, the patient is at high risk for developing opportunistic infections such as Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), toxoplasmosis, and Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) disease.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) recommend the following prophylactic medications for patients with HIV and low CD4+ counts:\n\n1. **Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX)**: This medication is used to prevent PCP, a common and potentially life-threatening opportunistic infection in HIV-infected individuals with low CD4+ counts.\n2. **Isoniazid (INH)**: This medication is used to prevent latent tuberculosis (TB) from reactivating, which is a concern in patients with low CD4+ counts.\n\nAdditionally, the patient should also be evaluated for other opportunistic infections, such as toxoplasmosis, and receive prophylaxis if necessary.\n\nIt's also essential to address the patient's depression, which is likely contributing to his non-adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART). A mental health professional should be consulted to develop a plan to manage the patient's depression and improve his adherence to ART.\n\nIn summary, the patient should take TMP-SMX and INH prophylaxis in addition to his anti-retroviral therapy, and receive evaluation and management for other opportunistic infections and depression.",
    "true_answer": "In addition to his antiretroviral therapy, the patient should take azithromycin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole to prevent opportunistic infections."

    "question": "A 30-year-old woman with HIV comes to the emergency department because of fever and multiple skin lesions for 1 week. She also has nausea, anorexia, and abdominal pain. The skin lesions are non-pruritic and painless. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 15 years and drinks 2 beers daily. She has been using intravenous crack cocaine for 6 years. She appears ill. Her temperature is 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F), pulse is 105/min, blood pressure is 110/75 mm Hg. Her BMI is 19 kg/m2. Examination shows track marks on both cubital fossae. There are white patches on her palate that can be scraped off. There are several red papules measuring 1 to 2 cm on her face and trunk. Her CD4+T-lymphocyte count is 98/mm3 (N \u2265 500). Biopsy of a skin lesion shows vascular proliferation and small black bacteria on Warthin-Starry stain. What is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy?",
    "answer": "Based on the clinical presentation and biopsy results, the most likely diagnosis is bacillary angiomatosis (BA) caused by Bartonella henselae or Bartonella quintana. The presence of vascular proliferation and small black bacteria on Warthin-Starry stain is consistent with this diagnosis.\n\nThe most appropriate pharmacotherapy for bacillary angiomatosis in a patient with HIV is:\n\n1. Doxycycline 100 mg orally twice daily for at least 3 months. Doxycycline is the first-line treatment for BA and is effective against both B. henselae and B. quintana.\n\nAlternatively, erythromycin 500 mg orally four times daily for at least 3 months can be used if the patient is allergic to doxycycline or has a contraindication to its use.\n\nIn addition to antibiotics, the patient should also receive antiretroviral therapy (ART) to manage her HIV infection. The goal of ART is to suppress the viral load and restore the CD4+ T-lymphocyte count, which will help to reduce the risk of opportunistic infections such as BA.\n\nIt's also important to address the patient's other health issues, including her history of smoking, alcohol use, and intravenous drug use, as these can contribute to her overall health and increase her risk of complications.",
    "true_answer": "The most appropriate pharmacotherapy for this patient is erythromycin."

    "question": "A 35-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 6-month history of fatigue and increased sweating at night. He says that he feels 'constantly tired' and needs more rest than usual although he sleeps well. In the morning, his sheets are often wet and his skin is clammy. He has not had any sore throat, runny nose, or cough recently. He has not traveled anywhere. Over the past 4 months, he has had a 6.8-kg (15-lb) weight loss, despite having a normal appetite. He does not drink or urinate more than usual. He is 181 cm (5 ft 11 in) tall and weighs 72 kg (159 lb); BMI is 22 kg/m2. His temperature is 37.9\u00b0C (100.2\u00b0F), pulse is 65/min, and blood pressure is 120/70 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. An HIV screening test and confirmatory test are both positive. The CD4 count is 600 cells/\u03bcl and the viral load is 104 copies/mL. Treatment with lamivudine, zidovudine, and indinavir is begun. The patient is at greatest risk for what adverse effects?",
    "answer": "Given the patient's treatment regimen of lamivudine, zidovudine, and indinavir, he is at greatest risk for the following adverse effects:\n\n1. **Lactic acidosis and hepatomegaly with steatosis (lamivudine and zidovudine)**: Both of these nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) can cause mitochondrial toxicity, leading to lactic acidosis and hepatomegaly with steatosis.\n2. **Bone marrow suppression (zidovudine)**: Zidovudine can cause anemia, neutropenia, and other cytopenias due to its effect on bone marrow.\n3. **Gastrointestinal intolerance (indinavir)**: Indinavir, a protease inhibitor, can cause gastrointestinal side effects such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain.\n4. **Nephrolithiasis (indinavir)**: Indinavir can increase the risk of kidney stones due to its excretion in the urine.\n5. **Metabolic changes (indinavir and other protease inhibitors)**: Protease inhibitors, including indinavir, can contribute to metabolic changes such as insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and body fat redistribution (lipodystrophy).\n\nIt's worth noting that the patient's treatment regimen is an older combination, and newer antiretroviral therapies (ART) have fewer side effects and are often better tolerated. However, the patient's healthcare provider will closely monitor him for these potential adverse effects and adjust his treatment regimen as needed.",
    "true_answer": "The patient is at greatest risk for developing urolithiasis as an adverse effect."

    "question": "A 52-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of headaches, vertigo, and changes to his personality for the past few weeks. He was diagnosed with HIV 14 years ago and was started on antiretroviral therapy at that time. Medical records from one month ago indicate that he followed his medication schedule inconsistently. Since then, he has been regularly taking his antiretroviral medications and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His vital signs are within normal limits. Neurological examination shows ataxia and apathy. Mini-Mental State Examination score is 15/30. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 12.5 g/dL Leukocyte count 8400/mm3 Segmented neutrophils 80% Eosinophils 1% Lymphocytes 17% Monocytes 2% CD4+ T-lymphocytes 90/\u03bcL Platelet count 328,000/mm3 An MRI of the brain with contrast shows a solitary ring-enhancing lesion involving the corpus callosum and measuring 4.5 cm in diameter. A lumbar puncture with subsequent cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows slight pleocytosis, and PCR is positive for Epstein-Barr virus DNA. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "Based on the clinical presentation, laboratory results, and imaging findings, the most likely diagnosis is:\n\n**Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma (PCNSL)**\n\nHere's why:\n\n1. **Clinical presentation**: The patient's symptoms, such as headaches, vertigo, changes in personality, ataxia, and apathy, are consistent with a central nervous system (CNS) disorder.\n2. **Immunocompromised status**: The patient has a history of HIV infection and a low CD4+ T-lymphocyte count, which increases his risk for opportunistic infections and malignancies, including PCNSL.\n3. **MRI findings**: The solitary ring-enhancing lesion involving the corpus callosum is a characteristic imaging feature of PCNSL.\n4. **Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis**: The slight pleocytosis and presence of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA in the CSF are consistent with PCNSL, which is often associated with EBV infection.\n5. **Exclusion of other possibilities**: The patient's symptoms and imaging findings are not typical of toxoplasmosis, cryptococcal meningitis, or other opportunistic infections that can occur in HIV-infected individuals.\n\nPCNSL is a rare but aggressive form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that occurs primarily in the brain and/or eyes. It is more common in immunocompromised individuals, including those with HIV/AIDS. Treatment typically involves chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or a combination of both.\n\nIt's worth noting that the patient's inconsistent adherence to antiretroviral therapy may have contributed to his immunocompromised state and increased risk for developing PCNSL.",
