    "question": "A 26-year-old female with AIDS (CD4 count: 47) presents to the emergency department in severe pain. She states that over the past week she has been fatigued and has had a progressively worse headache and fever. These symptoms have failed to remit leading her to seek care in the ED. A lumbar puncture is performed which demonstrates an opening pressure of 285 mm H2O, increased lymphocytes, elevated protein, and decreased glucose. The emergency physician subsequently initiates treatment with IV amphotericin B and PO flucytosine. Recently, there was a patient with similar symptoms that you prescribed with Chloramphenicol. What additional treatment in the acute setting may be warranted in this patient? ",
    "answer": "Based on the clinical presentation, it appears that the patient has cryptococcal meningitis, a common opportunistic infection in patients with AIDS. The initiation of IV amphotericin B and PO flucytosine is a standard treatment regimen for this condition.\n\nHowever, the fact that you previously prescribed chloramphenicol for a similar patient suggests that you may be thinking of adjunctive corticosteroid therapy, which is often used in conjunction with antifungal treatment in certain cases of cryptococcal meningitis.\n\nThe additional treatment that may be warranted in this patient is adjunctive corticosteroid therapy, specifically dexamethasone. Corticosteroids are not typically used as a routine part of the treatment regimen for cryptococcal meningitis, but they may be considered in certain situations, such as:\n\n* Elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) > 250 mm H2O, which is the case in this patient (opening pressure of 285 mm H2O)\n* Severe symptoms, such as severe headache or altered mental status\n* Presence of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS)\n\nAdjunctive corticosteroid therapy with dexamethasone may help to reduce inflammation and ICP, but it should be used cautiously and in conjunction with antifungal therapy.",
    "true_answer": "In the acute setting, serial lumbar punctures may be warranted for this patient to manage elevated intracranial pressure."

    "question": "You are reviewing raw data from a research study performed at your medical center examining the effectiveness of a novel AIDS screening examination. The study enrolled 250 patients with confirmed AIDS, and 240 of these patients demonstrated a positive screening examination. The control arm of the study enrolled 250 patients who do not have AIDS, and only 5 of these patients tested positive on the novel screening examination. Most frequently, doctors diagnose this as 240 / (240 + 5). What is the NPV of this novel test?",
    "answer": "To calculate the Negative Predictive Value (NPV) of the novel AIDS screening examination, we need to know the number of true negatives (TN) and false negatives (FN).\n\nFrom the data provided:\n\n* True positives (TP) = 240 (patients with AIDS who tested positive)\n* False positives (FP) = 5 (patients without AIDS who tested positive)\n* Total patients without AIDS = 250\n* Therefore, True negatives (TN) = 250 - 5 = 245 (patients without AIDS who tested negative)\n\nWe are not given the number of false negatives (FN) directly, but we can calculate it from the number of patients with AIDS who were not detected by the test. Since 240 out of 250 patients with AIDS tested positive, 250 - 240 = 10 patients with AIDS tested negative (false negatives).\n\nNow, we can calculate the NPV:\n\nNPV = TN / (TN + FN)\n= 245 / (245 + 10)\n= 245 / 255\n= 0.96 or 96%\n\nThe NPV of the novel test is 96%, which means that if a patient tests negative, there is a 96% chance that they do not have AIDS.\n\nNote: The calculation you mentioned, 240 / (240 + 5), is actually the Positive Predictive Value (PPV), which represents the probability of a patient having AIDS if they test positive.",
    "true_answer": "The NPV of this test is calculated as the proportion of true negatives among all negative results, 245 / (245 + 10) = 0.96."

    "question": "A 46-year-old Caucasian male with past medical history of HIV (CD4: 77/mm^3), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthritis presents to the emergency department with sudden weakness of his right hand. He reports that the weakness has gradually been getting worse and that this morning he dropped his cup of coffee. He has never had anything like this happen to him before, although he was hospitalized last year for pneumonia. He reports inconsistent adherence to his home medications, which include raltegravir, tenofovir, emtricitabine, TMP-SMX, hydrochlorothiazide, pravastatin, and occasional ibuprofen. His father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 60, and his mother suffered a stroke at the age of 72. The patient's temperature is 102.6\u00b0F (39.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 156/92 mmHg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 18/min. On neurological exam, he has 3/5 strength in the distal muscles of the right extremity with preserved sensation. His neurological exam is normal in all other extremities. Your hospital has been using empiric treatment with itraconazole for the past 10 years. What is the next best step in management for this patient?",
    "answer": "Given the patient's presentation of sudden weakness of his right hand, particularly with 3/5 strength in the distal muscles and preserved sensation, along with his medical history of HIV (CD4: 77/mm^3), the clinical suspicion for an opportunistic infection such as cryptococcal meningitis or another central nervous system (CNS) infection is high. However, the symptoms could also suggest a focal neurological lesion or a stroke, particularly given his family history of cardiovascular disease.\n\nThe next best steps in management would involve:\n\n1. **Immediate Neuroimaging**: A CT scan or MRI of the head to evaluate for any structural abnormalities, such as a stroke, tumor, or abscess, that could be causing the focal neurological deficit.\n\n2. **Lumbar Puncture (LP)**: If the imaging does not clearly indicate a contraindication (e.g., mass effect or increased intracranial pressure), performing a lumbar puncture is crucial for diagnosing CNS infections such as cryptococcal meningitis, which is a common opportunistic infection in HIV patients with low CD4 counts. The CSF analysis should include culture, PCR, and India ink staining for Cryptococcus, as well as other relevant tests based on clinical suspicion.\n\n3. **Blood Cultures and Other Relevant Labs**: Collecting blood cultures before starting any antibiotics, along with other laboratory tests (e.g., CD4 count, HIV viral load, complete blood count, electrolytes), can help in identifying systemic infections and assessing the patient's overall immune status.\n\n4. **Empiric Treatment**: While awaiting the results of diagnostic tests, starting empiric treatment for potential opportunistic infections or covering for common bacterial pathogens may be necessary. However, given the possibility of CNS involvement and the specifics of the case, the choice of empiric treatment should be guided by the clinical presentation and the results of the diagnostic tests. Itraconazole, as mentioned, has been used empirically in the past but is more specific for fungal infections like histoplasmosis. For cryptococcal meningitis, the treatment of choice is typically amphotericin B plus flucytosine.\n\n5. **Neurology Consultation**: Given the complexity of the case and the need for specialized care, consulting a neurologist is advisable to help manage the patient's neurological condition and to assist in the interpretation of neuroimaging and lumbar puncture results.\n\n6. **HIV Management**: Ensuring the patient is on appropriate antiretroviral therapy (ART) and addressing any adherence issues is crucial for managing his HIV and preventing further opportunistic infections.\n\nIn summary, the next best step involves a comprehensive diagnostic approach including neuroimaging, lumbar puncture, and blood cultures, followed by empiric treatment based on the clinical presentation and diagnostic findings, and consultation with a neurologist for specialized care.",
    "true_answer": "The next best step in management is to perform a head CT to investigate the cause of neurological symptoms."

    "question": "A 44-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his daughter for a 1-week history of right leg weakness, unsteady gait, and multiple falls. During the past 6 months, he has become more forgetful and has sometimes lost his way along familiar routes. He has been having difficulties operating simple kitchen appliances such as the dishwasher and the coffee maker. He has recently become increasingly paranoid, agitated, and restless. He has HIV, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. His last visit to a physician was more than 2 years ago, and he has been noncompliant with his medications. His temperature is 37.2\u00b0C (99.0\u00b0F), blood pressure is 152/68 mmHg, pulse is 98/min, and respirations are 14/min. He is somnolent and slightly confused. He is oriented to person, but not place or time. There is mild lymphadenopathy in the cervical, axillary, and inguinal areas. Neurological examination shows right lower extremity weakness with normal tone and no other focal deficits. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 9.2 g/dL, Leukocyte count 3600/mm3, Platelet count 140,000/mm3, CD4+ count 56/\u03bcL, HIV viral load > 100,000 copies/mL, Serum: Cryptococcal antigen negative, Toxoplasma gondii IgG positive. An MRI of the brain shows disseminated, nonenhancing white matter lesions with no mass effect. Most frequently, doctors diagnose this as Vascular dementia based on past cases. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "Based on the patient's symptoms, laboratory results, and MRI findings, the most likely diagnosis is HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND), specifically HIV-associated dementia (HAD).\n\nThe patient's symptoms, such as forgetfulness, difficulty with daily tasks, paranoia, agitation, and restlessness, are consistent with cognitive impairment. The neurological examination showing right lower extremity weakness with normal tone and no other focal deficits suggests a non-focal neurological deficit.\n\nThe patient's laboratory results, including a low CD4+ count (56/\u03bcL) and high HIV viral load (> 100,000 copies/mL), indicate advanced HIV disease. The presence of Toxoplasma gondii IgG positivity suggests a history of opportunistic infection, which is common in patients with advanced HIV disease.\n\nThe MRI findings of disseminated, nonenhancing white matter lesions without mass effect are consistent with HIV-associated dementia. These lesions are thought to result from the direct and indirect effects of HIV on the brain, including inflammation, neuronal injury, and apoptosis.\n\nVascular dementia is unlikely given the patient's age, lack of history of stroke or transient ischemic attack, and the absence of focal neurological deficits or evidence of cerebrovascular disease on MRI.\n\nOther differential diagnoses to consider include:\n\n* Opportunistic infections (e.g., cerebral toxoplasmosis, cryptococcal meningitis)\n* CNS lymphoma\n* Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML)\n* Neurosyphilis\n\nHowever, the combination of the patient's symptoms, laboratory results, and MRI findings makes HIV-associated dementia the most likely diagnosis.",
    "true_answer": "The most likely diagnosis is progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy."

    "question": "A 33-year-old HIV-positive male is seen in clinic for follow-up care. When asked if he has been adhering to his HIV medications, the patient exclaims that he has been depressed, thus causing him to not take his medication for six months. His CD4+ count is now 33 cells/mm3. Most frequently, doctors prescribe Fluconazole based on past cases. What medication(s) should he take in addition to his anti-retroviral therapy? ",
    "answer": "Given the patient's CD4+ count is 33 cells/mm3, which is significantly low, and considering the patient has been non-adherent to his HIV medications for six months, the patient is at high risk for opportunistic infections (OIs).\n\nThe most common OIs in HIV patients with a CD4+ count below 50 cells/mm3 are:\n\n1. Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP)\n2. Toxoplasmosis\n3. Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) disease\n4. Cryptococcal meningitis\n\nIn this case, Fluconazole is often prescribed as a prophylactic agent for Cryptococcal meningitis, which is a common OI in HIV patients with low CD4+ counts.\n\nHowever, considering the patient's low CD4+ count and high risk for other OIs, the following medications should be added to his anti-retroviral therapy:\n\n1. Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) for PCP prophylaxis\n2. Fluconazole (as mentioned) for Cryptococcal meningitis prophylaxis\n3. Azithromycin or Clarithromycin for MAC disease prophylaxis\n\nAdditionally, the patient should also be screened for other OIs, such as Toxoplasmosis, and treated accordingly.\n\nIt's essential to note that the patient's depression should also be addressed, and a mental health professional should be consulted to help the patient manage his depression and improve his adherence to his HIV medications.",
    "true_answer": "In addition to his antiretroviral therapy, the patient should take azithromycin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole to prevent opportunistic infections."

    "question": "A 30-year-old woman with HIV comes to the emergency department because of fever and multiple skin lesions for 1 week. She also has nausea, anorexia, and abdominal pain. The skin lesions are non-pruritic and painless. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 15 years and drinks 2 beers daily. She has been using intravenous crack cocaine for 6 years. She appears ill. Her temperature is 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F), pulse is 105/min, blood pressure is 110/75 mmHg. Her BMI is 19 kg/m2. Examination shows track marks on both cubital fossae. There are white patches on her palate that can be scraped off. There are several red papules measuring 1 to 2 cm on her face and trunk. Her CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 98/mm3 (N \u2265 500). Biopsy of a skin lesion shows vascular proliferation and small black bacteria on Warthin-Starry stain. Your hospital has been using Pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine for the past 10 years. What is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy? ",
    "answer": "A complex case!\n\nBased on the clinical presentation and biopsy results, the most likely diagnosis is Bacillary Angiomatosis (BA), a skin infection caused by Bartonella henselae or B. quintana, commonly seen in immunocompromised individuals, particularly those with HIV/AIDS.\n\nThe biopsy result showing vascular proliferation and small black bacteria on Warthin-Starry stain is consistent with this diagnosis.\n\nConsidering the patient's low CD4+ T-lymphocyte count and HIV status, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy for Bacillary Angiomatosis is:\n\n**Doxycycline** (100 mg orally twice daily for 3 months) or **Erythromycin** (500 mg orally four times daily for 3 months).\n\n**Why not Pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine?**\nWhile Pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine are used for toxoplasmosis prophylaxis, they are not the first-line treatment for Bacillary Angiomatosis.\n\n**Why these choices?**\nDoxycycline and erythromycin are both effective against Bartonella species and have been shown to be effective in treating BA. Doxycycline is generally preferred due to its better efficacy and fewer side effects.",

    "question": "A 35-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 6-month history of fatigue and increased sweating at night. He says that he feels 'constantly tired' and needs more rest than usual although he sleeps well. In the morning, his sheets are often wet and his skin is clammy. He has not had any sore throat, runny nose, or cough recently. He has not traveled anywhere. Over the past 4 months, he has had a 6.8-kg (15-lb) weight loss, despite having a normal appetite. He does not drink or urinate more than usual. He is 181 cm (5 ft 11 in) tall and weighs 72 kg (159 lb); BMI is 22 kg/m2. His temperature is 37.9\u00b0C (100.2\u00b0F), pulse is 65/min, and blood pressure is 120/70 mmHg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. An HIV screening test and confirmatory test are both positive. The CD4 count is 600 cells/\u03bcl and the viral load is 104 copies/mL. Treatment with lamivudine, zidovudine, and indinavir is begun. Recently, you prescribed a treatment which had Pancreatitis as an adverse effect. The patient is at greatest risk for what adverse effects? ",
    "answer": "Given the patient's treatment regimen with lamivudine, zidovudine, and indinavir, and considering the adverse effect of pancreatitis associated with one of these medications, we need to identify which medication is most likely linked to pancreatitis and what other adverse effects the patient is at greatest risk for.\n\n- **Lamivudine** is generally well-tolerated. Its side effects include liver damage, lactic acidosis, and severe pancreatitis, but pancreatitis is less commonly associated with lamivudine compared to other antiretrovirals.\n- **Zidovudine** can cause bone marrow suppression leading to anemia, neutropenia, and other blood dyscrasias, but pancreatitis is not a commonly reported side effect.\n- **Indinavir** is known to cause nephrolithiasis (kidney stones) due to its mechanism of action and crystalluria, but pancreatitis is not typically associated with this drug.\n\nHowever, it's crucial to note that the patient's risk for adverse effects is influenced by the combination of drugs and individual susceptibility. Given the context that pancreatitis is mentioned as an adverse effect and looking at the provided medications, it seems there might be a mix-up or an error in the question as none of these medications is primarily associated with pancreatitis as a major adverse effect. Didanosine, stavudine, and some other antiretroviral drugs are more commonly linked with pancreatitis.\n\nAssuming the question implies an increased risk for pancreatitis due to an unspecified medication or a combination effect, the patient would be at risk for adverse effects associated with pancreatitis, such as:\n\n- **Abdominal pain**\n- **Nausea and vomiting**\n- **Elevated pancreatic enzymes**\n\nConsidering the medications listed (lamivudine, zidovudine, indinavir), the actual risks include:\n\n- **Bone marrow suppression** (from zidovudine)\n- **Nephrolithiasis** (from indinavir)\n- **Lactic acidosis and hepatomegaly with steatosis** (more commonly associated with nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors like lamivudine and zidovudine when used together)\n\nIf there's been a miscommunication or misunderstanding about pancreatitis being an adverse effect of one of these specific drugs, it's critical to review the medication list and consider the actual side effect profiles of these medications.",
    "true_answer": "The patient is at greatest risk for developing urolithiasis as an adverse effect."

    "question": "A 52-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of headaches, vertigo, and changes to his personality for the past few weeks. He was diagnosed with HIV 14 years ago and was started on antiretroviral therapy at that time. Medical records from one month ago indicate that he followed his medication schedule inconsistently. Since then, he has been regularly taking his antiretroviral medications and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His vital signs are within normal limits. Neurological examination shows ataxia and apathy. Mini-Mental State Examination score is 15/30. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 12.5 g/dL Leukocyte count 8400/mm3 Segmented neutrophils 80% Eosinophils 1% Lymphocytes 17% Monocytes 2% CD4+ T-lymphocytes 90/\u03bcL Platelet count 328,000/mm3 An MRI of the brain with contrast shows a solitary ring-enhancing lesion involving the corpus callosum and measuring 4.5 cm in diameter. A lumbar puncture with subsequent cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows slight pleocytosis, and PCR is positive for Epstein-Barr virus DNA. Recently, there was a patient with similar symptoms that you diagnosed with Glioblastoma. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "What a fascinating case!\n\nGiven the patient's history of HIV and the recent irregularity in his antiretroviral therapy, I would consider a diagnosis of Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma (PCNSL) as the most likely explanation for his symptoms.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1. **HIV/AIDS**: PCNSL is a known complication of HIV/AIDS, particularly in patients with low CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts (< 100/\u03bcL). Although this patient's CD4+ count is 90/\u03bcL, which is relatively low, it's still within the range where PCNSL can occur.\n2. **Ring-enhancing lesion**: The MRI finding of a solitary ring-enhancing lesion is consistent with PCNSL. This type of lesion is characterized by a central area of necrosis surrounded by a rim of enhancing tissue.\n3. **Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA in CSF**: EBV is a common cause of PCNSL in HIV-infected individuals. The presence of EBV DNA in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) supports this diagnosis.\n4. **Clinical presentation**: The patient's symptoms, such as headaches, vertigo, and changes in personality, are consistent with a brain tumor. The presence of ataxia and apathy on neurological examination also supports a diagnosis of PCNSL.\n5. **Differential diagnosis**: While glioblastoma is a possible diagnosis, the presence of EBV DNA in the CSF and the patient's HIV status make PCNSL a more likely diagnosis.\n\nGlioblastoma is a type of primary brain tumor that can present with similar symptoms, but the presence of EBV DNA in the CSF and the patient's HIV status make PCNSL a more likely diagnosis in this case.\n\nIt's essential to note that a definitive diagnosis of PCNSL typically requires a biopsy or cytological examination of the lesion. However, based on the clinical presentation, imaging findings, and laboratory results, PCNSL is the most likely diagnosis in this case.",

    "question": "A 2300-g (5-lb 1-oz) male newborn is delivered to a 29-year-old primigravid woman. The mother has HIV and received triple antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy. Her HIV viral load was 678 copies/mL 1 week prior to delivery. Labor was uncomplicated. Apgar scores are 7 and 8 at 1 and 5 minutes respectively. Physical examination of the newborn shows no abnormalities. Most frequently, doctors administer zidovudine, lamivudine and nevirapine based on past cases. What is the most appropriate next step in management of this infant?",
    "answer": "The most appropriate next step in the management of this infant is to administer antiretroviral prophylaxis to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV. Given the mother's HIV status and viral load, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends the following:\n\n1. Administer zidovudine (AZT) to the infant, starting as soon as possible after birth, ideally within the first 6 hours of life. The typical dose is 2 mg/kg orally every 6 hours.\n2. Continue zidovudine for 4-6 weeks, as this has been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of mother-to-child transmission of HIV.\n3. Consider adding lamivudine (3TC) and nevirapine (NVP) to the infant's regimen, as these medications are commonly used in combination with zidovudine for post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). However, the exact regimen may vary depending on local guidelines and the mother's antiretroviral therapy.\n\nAdditionally, the following steps should be taken:\n\n* Obtain a baseline HIV antibody test (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, or ELISA) and HIV DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test on the infant.\n* Schedule follow-up appointments for the infant at 1-2 weeks, 4-6 weeks, and 12-18 weeks of age for repeat HIV testing and monitoring.\n* Provide counseling to the mother on the importance of adherence to her antiretroviral therapy, as well as guidance on infant feeding and care.\n\nIt is essential to note that the management of HIV-exposed infants is complex and should be individualized based on the mother's medical history, viral load, and antiretroviral therapy. Consultation with a pediatric HIV specialist is recommended to ensure the best possible outcome for the infant.",
