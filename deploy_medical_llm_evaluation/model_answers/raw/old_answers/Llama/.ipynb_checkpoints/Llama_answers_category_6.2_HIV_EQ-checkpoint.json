    "question": "A 26-year-old female with AIDS (CD4 count: 47) presents to the emergency department in severe pain. She states that over the past week she has been fatigued and has had a progressively worse headache and fever. These symptoms have failed to remit leading her to seek care in the ED. A lumbar puncture is performed which demonstrates an opening pressure of 285 mm H2O, increased lymphocytes, elevated protein, and decreased glucose. The emergency physician subsequently initiates treatment with IV amphotericin B and PO flucytosine. Recently, there was a patient with similar symptoms that you prescribed with Chloramphenicol. What additional treatment in the acute setting may be warranted in this patient? ",
    "answer": "Based on the patient's presentation and lab results, it appears she has cryptococcal meningitis, which is a common opportunistic infection in patients with AIDS, particularly those with low CD4 counts.\n\nThe treatment initiated by the emergency physician, IV amphotericin B and PO flucytosine, is standard for cryptococcal meningitis.\n\nConsidering the recent patient with similar symptoms who was prescribed chloramphenicol, which is an antibiotic used to treat bacterial meningitis, it's possible that the current patient may have been misdiagnosed or had a co-infection.\n\nIn the acute setting, additional treatment that may be warranted in this patient includes:\n\n1. **Adjunctive corticosteroids**: Dexamethasone or methylprednisolone may be considered to reduce inflammation and prevent complications, such as cerebral edema or herniation.\n2. **Anticonvulsants**: Seizures can occur in patients with cryptococcal meningitis, so anticonvulsants like phenytoin or levetiracetam may be considered as prophylaxis.\n3. **Supportive care**: Aggressive management of symptoms, such as pain, fever, and fatigue, is crucial. This may include analgesics, antipyretics, and rest.\n4. **Monitoring and management of intracranial pressure**: Regular lumbar punctures may be necessary to manage elevated intracranial pressure and prevent complications.\n5. **Evaluation for other opportunistic infections**: Given the patient's immunocompromised state, it's essential to evaluate for other opportunistic infections, such as toxoplasmosis, CMV, or PML.\n\nHowever, it's essential to note that chloramphenicol is not typically used to treat cryptococcal meningitis. The treatment initiated by the emergency physician is the standard of care for this condition.",
    "true_answer": "In the acute setting, serial lumbar punctures may be warranted for this patient to manage elevated intracranial pressure."

    "question": "You are reviewing raw data from a research study performed at your medical center examining the effectiveness of a novel AIDS screening examination. The study enrolled 250 patients with confirmed AIDS, and 240 of these patients demonstrated a positive screening examination. The control arm of the study enrolled 250 patients who do not have AIDS, and only 5 of these patients tested positive on the novel screening examination. Most frequently, doctors diagnose this as 240 / (240 + 5). What is the NPV of this novel test?",
    "answer": "To calculate the NPV (Negative Predictive Value) of the novel AIDS screening test, we need to understand what NPV is. The NPV is the proportion of individuals with a negative test result who actually do not have the disease.\n\nGiven data:\n- Total patients with confirmed AIDS (disease positive) = 250\n- Patients with confirmed AIDS and positive screening (true positives) = 240\n- Patients without AIDS (disease negative) = 250\n- Patients without AIDS but tested positive (false positives) = 5\n\nFirst, we need to find the number of true negatives, which are the patients without AIDS who also tested negative:\nTrue negatives = Total without AIDS - False positives\nTrue negatives = 250 - 5 = 245\n\nNext, we need to find the total number of patients who tested negative. This includes both the true negatives (those without AIDS who tested negative) and the false negatives (those with AIDS who tested negative):\nFalse negatives = Total with AIDS - True positives\nFalse negatives = 250 - 240 = 10\n\nTotal tested negative = True negatives + False negatives\nTotal tested negative = 245 + 10 = 255\n\nNow, we can calculate the NPV:\nNPV = True negatives / (True negatives + False negatives)\nNPV = 245 / 255\n\nCalculating the NPV:\nNPV = 245 / 255 \u2248 0.9608 or 96.08%\n\nSo, the NPV of this novel test is approximately 96.08%. This means that about 96.08% of the individuals who test negative using this screening examination actually do not have AIDS.",
    "true_answer": "The NPV of this test is calculated as the proportion of true negatives among all negative results, 245 / (245 + 10) = 0.96."

    "question": "A 46-year-old Caucasian male with past medical history of HIV (CD4: 77/mm^3), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthritis presents to the emergency department with sudden weakness of his right hand. He reports that the weakness has gradually been getting worse and that this morning he dropped his cup of coffee. He has never had anything like this happen to him before, although he was hospitalized last year for pneumonia. He reports inconsistent adherence to his home medications, which include raltegravir, tenofovir, emtricitabine, TMP-SMX, hydrochlorothiazide, pravastatin, and occasional ibuprofen. His father died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 60, and his mother suffered a stroke at the age of 72. The patient's temperature is 102.6\u00b0F (39.2\u00b0C), blood pressure is 156/92 mmHg, pulse is 88/min, and respirations are 18/min. On neurological exam, he has 3/5 strength in the distal muscles of the right extremity with preserved sensation. His neurological exam is normal in all other extremities. Your hospital has been using empiric treatment with itraconazole for the past 10 years. What is the next best step in management for this patient?",
    "answer": "A fascinating case! Based on the patient's presentation, I'll walk you through the thought process and suggest the next best step in management.\n\n**Clinical Presentation:**\nThe patient presents with sudden weakness of his right hand, which has been worsening over time. He has a history of HIV with a low CD4 count, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, osteoarthritis, and inconsistent adherence to his medications.\n\n**Differential Diagnosis:**\nGiven the patient's HIV status and low CD4 count, we should consider opportunistic infections, particularly those that affect the central nervous system (CNS). The differential diagnosis includes:\n\n1. Cryptococcal meningitis (CM)\n2. Toxoplasmosis\n3. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML)\n4. CNS lymphoma\n5. Stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA)\n\n**Cryptococcal Meningitis (CM) Consideration:**\nCM is a common opportunistic infection in HIV patients with low CD4 counts. The patient's presentation with sudden weakness, fever, and a history of pneumonia (which could be a sign of previous cryptococcal infection) raises the suspicion for CM.\n\n**Itraconazole Use:**\nWhile itraconazole is an antifungal agent, it is not the first-line treatment for CM. In fact, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend amphotericin B and flucytosine as the initial therapy for CM.\n\n**Next Best Step:**\nConsidering the patient's clinical presentation and the possibility of CM, the next best step would be to:\n\n1. **Perform a lumbar puncture (LP)** to collect cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for analysis, including:\n\t* Cryptococcal antigen (CrAg) testing\n\t* Fungal culture\n\t* Gram stain and bacterial culture (to rule out bacterial meningitis)\n\t* CSF protein and glucose levels\n2. **Initiate empiric treatment with amphotericin B and flucytosine**, pending the results of the LP, if CM is suspected.\n3. **Order a brain imaging study (e.g., CT or MRI)** to evaluate for any structural abnormalities, such as a mass lesion or hydrocephalus.\n\nBy taking these steps, we can rapidly diagnose and treat the patient's condition, potentially saving his life and preventing further neurological damage.",
    "true_answer": "The next best step in management is to perform a head CT to investigate the cause of neurological symptoms."

    "question": "A 44-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by his daughter for a 1-week history of right leg weakness, unsteady gait, and multiple falls. During the past 6 months, he has become more forgetful and has sometimes lost his way along familiar routes. He has been having difficulties operating simple kitchen appliances such as the dishwasher and the coffee maker. He has recently become increasingly paranoid, agitated, and restless. He has HIV, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. His last visit to a physician was more than 2 years ago, and he has been noncompliant with his medications. His temperature is 37.2\u00b0C (99.0\u00b0F), blood pressure is 152/68 mmHg, pulse is 98/min, and respirations are 14/min. He is somnolent and slightly confused. He is oriented to person, but not place or time. There is mild lymphadenopathy in the cervical, axillary, and inguinal areas. Neurological examination shows right lower extremity weakness with normal tone and no other focal deficits. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 9.2 g/dL, Leukocyte count 3600/mm3, Platelet count 140,000/mm3, CD4+ count 56/\u03bcL, HIV viral load > 100,000 copies/mL, Serum: Cryptococcal antigen negative, Toxoplasma gondii IgG positive. An MRI of the brain shows disseminated, nonenhancing white matter lesions with no mass effect. Most frequently, doctors diagnose this as Vascular dementia based on past cases. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "Based on the patient's symptoms, laboratory results, and MRI findings, the most likely diagnosis is HIV-Associated Neurocognitive Disorder (HAND) with a specific subtype known as HIV-Associated Dementia (HAD).\n\nThe patient's symptoms, such as forgetfulness, difficulty with daily activities, personality changes (paranoia, agitation, restlessness), and motor symptoms (right leg weakness, unsteady gait), are consistent with HIV-Associated Dementia. The patient's CD4+ count is low (56/\u03bcL), indicating advanced HIV disease, and the HIV viral load is high (> 100,000 copies/mL), which is also consistent with HAD.\n\nThe MRI findings of disseminated, nonenhancing white matter lesions without mass effect are also characteristic of HAD. These lesions are thought to be caused by HIV-induced inflammation and damage to the brain's white matter.\n\nWhile Vascular dementia is a possible diagnosis, the patient's age, HIV status, and laboratory results make HAD a more likely diagnosis. Vascular dementia typically presents with a more step-wise progression of cognitive decline, often with a history of stroke or transient ischemic attacks, which is not mentioned in the patient's history.\n\nOther possible diagnoses, such as cryptococcal meningitis or toxoplasmosis, are less likely given the negative cryptococcal antigen and the presence of Toxoplasma gondii IgG antibodies, which may indicate past exposure rather than active infection.\n\nIn summary, the patient's clinical presentation, laboratory results, and MRI findings are most consistent with HIV-Associated Dementia (HAD).",
    "true_answer": "The most likely diagnosis is progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy."

    "question": "A 33-year-old HIV-positive male is seen in clinic for follow-up care. When asked if he has been adhering to his HIV medications, the patient exclaims that he has been depressed, thus causing him to not take his medication for six months. His CD4+ count is now 33 cells/mm3. Most frequently, doctors prescribe Fluconazole based on past cases. What medication(s) should he take in addition to his anti-retroviral therapy? ",
    "answer": "Given the patient's CD4+ count of 33 cells/mm3 and history of non-adherence to HIV medications, he is at high risk for opportunistic infections. Fluconazole is an antifungal medication often used to prevent and treat opportunistic fungal infections, such as oral thrush and cryptococcal meningitis, in HIV-positive individuals with low CD4+ counts.\n\nIn addition to restarting his anti-retroviral therapy (ART), the patient should be prescribed prophylactic medications to prevent opportunistic infections. The following medications are commonly prescribed:\n\n1. **Fluconazole (Diflucan)**: As you mentioned, Fluconazole is often prescribed for prophylaxis against fungal infections, particularly oral thrush and cryptococcal meningitis.\n2. **Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX, Bactrim)**: This antibiotic is used to prevent Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP), a common opportunistic infection in HIV-positive individuals with low CD4+ counts.\n3. **Valganciclovir (Valcyte)**: This antiviral medication is used to prevent cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease, which can cause retinitis, colitis, and other complications in HIV-positive individuals with low CD4+ counts.\n\nThe patient should also be evaluated for other potential opportunistic infections, such as tuberculosis (TB), and receive appropriate prophylaxis or treatment if necessary.\n\nIt is essential to note that the patient's depression should also be addressed, as it may be contributing to his non-adherence to HIV medications. A mental health evaluation and treatment plan should be implemented to support the patient's overall well-being and adherence to ART.",
    "true_answer": "In addition to his antiretroviral therapy, the patient should take azithromycin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole to prevent opportunistic infections."

    "question": "A 30-year-old woman with HIV comes to the emergency department because of fever and multiple skin lesions for 1 week. She also has nausea, anorexia, and abdominal pain. The skin lesions are non-pruritic and painless. She has smoked one pack of cigarettes daily for 15 years and drinks 2 beers daily. She has been using intravenous crack cocaine for 6 years. She appears ill. Her temperature is 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F), pulse is 105/min, blood pressure is 110/75 mmHg. Her BMI is 19 kg/m2. Examination shows track marks on both cubital fossae. There are white patches on her palate that can be scraped off. There are several red papules measuring 1 to 2 cm on her face and trunk. Her CD4+ T-lymphocyte count is 98/mm3 (N \u2265 500). Biopsy of a skin lesion shows vascular proliferation and small black bacteria on Warthin-Starry stain. Your hospital has been using Pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine for the past 10 years. What is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy? ",
    "answer": "Based on the clinical presentation and biopsy findings, the most likely diagnosis is Bacillary Angiomatosis (BA), a disease caused by Bartonella henselae or Bartonella quintana.\n\nGiven the patient's HIV status and low CD4+ T-lymphocyte count, she is immunocompromised and at risk for opportunistic infections. The biopsy findings of vascular proliferation and small black bacteria on Warthin-Starry stain are characteristic of BA.\n\nThe most appropriate pharmacotherapy for Bacillary Angiomatosis is Erythromycin, which is the preferred treatment for this disease. It is usually given orally for 2-3 months to ensure complete resolution of the lesions.\n\nPyrimethamine and sulfadiazine are not the first-line treatment for BA. Pyrimethamine is typically used in combination with sulfadiazine for the treatment of Toxoplasmosis, which is another opportunistic infection that can occur in HIV-infected individuals.\n\nAzithromycin and Doxycycline are also effective treatments for BA, but Erythromycin is the most commonly recommended option.\n\nIt is worth noting that the patient's HIV status and low CD4+ T-lymphocyte count indicate that she may require antiretroviral therapy (ART) to manage her HIV infection and prevent further opportunistic infections. However, this is not the primary treatment for the current episode of BA.",

    "question": "A 52-year-old man is brought to the emergency department because of headaches, vertigo, and changes to his personality for the past few weeks. He was diagnosed with HIV 14 years ago and was started on antiretroviral therapy at that time. Medical records from one month ago indicate that he followed his medication schedule inconsistently. Since then, he has been regularly taking his antiretroviral medications and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. His vital signs are within normal limits. Neurological examination shows ataxia and apathy. Mini-Mental State Examination score is 15/30. Laboratory studies show: Hemoglobin 12.5 g/dL Leukocyte count 8400/mm3 Segmented neutrophils 80% Eosinophils 1% Lymphocytes 17% Monocytes 2% CD4+ T-lymphocytes 90/\u03bcL Platelet count 328,000/mm3 An MRI of the brain with contrast shows a solitary ring-enhancing lesion involving the corpus callosum and measuring 4.5 cm in diameter. A lumbar puncture with subsequent cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows slight pleocytosis, and PCR is positive for Epstein-Barr virus DNA. Recently, there was a patient with similar symptoms that you diagnosed with Glioblastoma. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "answer": "A very interesting case!\n\nGiven the patient's history of HIV, antiretroviral therapy, and recent inconsistent adherence to medication, I would say that the most likely diagnosis is Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma (PCNSL).\n\nHere's why:\n\n1. **HIV status**: PCNSL is a common opportunistic infection in HIV-infected individuals, especially those with low CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts (in this case, 90/\u03bcL).\n2. **Clinical presentation**: The patient's symptoms, such as headaches, vertigo, and changes in personality, are consistent with a space-occupying lesion in the brain.\n3. **Imaging findings**: The MRI shows a solitary ring-enhancing lesion involving the corpus callosum, which is typical of PCNSL.\n4. **Cerebrospinal fluid analysis**: The presence of slight pleocytosis and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA by PCR supports the diagnosis of PCNSL. EBV is a common cause of lymphoma in immunocompromised individuals.\n5. **Differential diagnosis**: While glioblastoma is a possibility, the patient's HIV status and the presence of EBV DNA in the cerebrospinal fluid make PCNSL more likely.\n\nGlioblastoma is a type of primary brain tumor that is more common in immunocompetent individuals, and it would be less likely in this patient with HIV and a history of opportunistic infections.\n\nOther possibilities, such as cerebral toxoplasmosis or progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), are less likely given the imaging findings and the presence of EBV DNA in the cerebrospinal fluid.\n\nIn summary, the combination of the patient's HIV status, clinical presentation, imaging findings, and cerebrospinal fluid analysis supports the diagnosis of Primary Central Nervous System Lymphoma (PCNSL).",

    "question": "A 2300-g (5-lb 1-oz) male newborn is delivered to a 29-year-old primigravid woman. The mother has HIV and received triple antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy. Her HIV viral load was 678 copies/mL 1 week prior to delivery. Labor was uncomplicated. Apgar scores are 7 and 8 at 1 and 5 minutes respectively. Physical examination of the newborn shows no abnormalities. Most frequently, doctors administer zidovudine, lamivudine and nevirapine based on past cases. What is the most appropriate next step in management of this infant?",
    "answer": "Given the mother's HIV status and the fact that she received triple antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy, the next step in managing the infant would be to administer antiretroviral prophylaxis to the newborn to reduce the risk of mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of HIV.\n\nThe most commonly recommended regimen for the newborn is zidovudine (AZT) monotherapy for 4-6 weeks, not the combination of zidovudine, lamivudine, and nevirapine. This is because the risks and benefits of combination therapy in newborns are not as well established as they are in adults.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics recommends the following:\n\n* Administer zidovudine syrup (2 mg/kg/dose) orally every 6 hours for 4-6 weeks.\n* Obtain an HIV DNA PCR test on the infant at birth, and repeat at 14-21 days, 1-2 months, and 4-6 months of age.\n* Monitor the infant for signs of HIV infection, such as rash, lymphadenopathy, and hepatosplenomegaly.\n\nIt's also important to note that the infant should be referred to a pediatric infectious disease specialist for further management and follow-up.\n\nIn this case, the most appropriate next step would be to administer zidovudine monotherapy to the newborn and obtain an HIV DNA PCR test at birth.",
