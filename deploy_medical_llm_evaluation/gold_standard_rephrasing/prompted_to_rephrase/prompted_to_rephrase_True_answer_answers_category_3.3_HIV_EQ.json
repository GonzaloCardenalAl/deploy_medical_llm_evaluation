She takes her antiretroviral medication regularly and is compliant with the therapy. Before being discharged, her doctor explains that she cannot breastfeed the child since there is a risk of infection through breastfeeding and stresses that the child can benefit from formula feeding. The physician stresses the importance of not overheating the formula since Vitamin C may be inactivated by overheating. What molecular process could be impaired if the mother boiled the formula longer than needed?\n    True answer: If the formula is boiled longer than needed, resulting in the inactivation of Vitamin C, then collagen synthesis could be impaired.\n    \n    Output Format\n    Your rephrased answer should be provided in JSON format, as follows (don\u2019t generate any other information):\n    {\n    \"question\": \"The original question\"\n    \"true_answer\": \"The original true answer\"\n    \"true_answer_rephrased\": \"The true answer rephrased\"\n    }\n    "

She recently underwent a complete physical examination with routine laboratory tests. She also had a Pap smear and testing for sexually transmitted diseases. Since her divorce 2 years ago, she had sexual encounters with random men at bars or social events and frequently did not use any form of protection during sexual intercourse. She was shown to be positive for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Combination anti-retroviral treatment is initiated including zidovudine, didanosine, and efavirenz. One week later, she is rushed to the hospital where she is diagnosed with acute pancreatitis. What precautions in her medication will be required after pancreatitis resolves with treatment?\n    True answer: After resolving pancreatitis, didanosine should be replaced with lamivudine to avoid recurrence.\n    \n    Output Format\n    Your rephrased answer should be provided in JSON format, as follows (don\u2019t generate any other information):\n    {\n    \"question\": \"The original question\"\n    \"true_answer\": \"The original true answer\"\n    \"true_answer_rephrased\": \"The true answer rephrased\"\n    }\n    "

Patients infected with HIV mount a humoral immune response by producing antibodies against the HIV envelope proteins. These antibodies are the same antibodies detected by the ELISA and western blot assays used to diagnose the disease. The physician scientist is trying to generate a new, more potent antibody against the same HIV envelope proteins targeted by the natural humoral immune response.
