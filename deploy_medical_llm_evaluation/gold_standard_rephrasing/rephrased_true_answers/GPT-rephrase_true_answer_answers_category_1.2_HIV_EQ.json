There are three types of tests used to diagnose HIV infection: antibody tests, antigen/antibody tests, and nucleic acid tests (NATs). How soon each test can detect HIV infection differs, because each test has a different window period. The window period is the time between when a person may have been exposed to HIV and when a test can accurately detect HIV infection. Window periods for different HIV tests are the followings: Antibody tests can usually detect HIV 23 to 90 days after exposure. Most rapid tests and self-tests are antibody tests. A rapid antigen/antibody test done with blood from a finger stick can usually detect HIV 18 to 90 days after exposure. An antigen/antibody lab test using blood from a vein can usually detect HIV 18 to 45 days after exposure. A NAT can usually detect HIV 10 to 33 days after exposure. When an HIV test is positive, a follow-up test will be conducted for confirmation. Sometimes people will need to visit a health care provider to take a follow-up test using another blood sample. Other times, the follow-up test may be performed in a lab using the original blood sample to ensure that the first positive result wasn\u2019t a false positive\",\n    \"true_answer_rephrased\": \"HIV diagnosis is achieved through serological and molecular testing methodologies. The diagnostic process involves three primary assays: serological antibody assays, combined antigen/antibody assays, and nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs). The detection window varies among these assays due to differing seroconversion periods. The seroconversion window is the interval between potential HIV exposure and the point at which the assay can reliably identify the infection. The detection windows for these assays are as follows: Serological antibody assays typically identify HIV infection between 23 to 90 days post-exposure, with most rapid and self-administered tests falling into this category. Rapid antigen/antibody assays utilizing capillary blood samples can detect HIV between 18 to 90 days post-exposure. Laboratory-based antigen/antibody assays using venous blood samples generally detect HIV between 18 to 45 days post-exposure. NAATs are capable of detecting HIV infection as early as 10 to 33 days post-exposure. Upon obtaining a positive result, confirmatory testing is essential. This may involve a subsequent visit to a healthcare provider for additional blood sampling or laboratory confirmation using the initial specimen to rule out false-positive results.\"\n}\n```"

To reduce the risk of getting HIV, it is important to use condoms correctly every time during sex. For individuals who inject drugs, avoiding drug use altogether is recommended, but if drugs are used, only sterile injection equipment and water should be used, and equipment should never be shared with others. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an option for those at risk of HIV, involving either a daily HIV medicine or an injectable HIV medicine every two months to lower the risk of infection through sex or injection drug use. For those already living with HIV, taking antiretroviral therapy (ART) as prescribed can reduce the amount of HIV in the blood to undetectable levels, preventing transmission to sexual partners. To prevent perinatal transmission, individuals with HIV who take HIV medicine as prescribed throughout pregnancy and childbirth reduce the risk of passing HIV to their baby to less than 1%. Additionally, in cases where one partner has HIV, PrEP can help protect both the individual and their baby while trying to conceive, during pregnancy, or while breastfeeding.\",\n    \"true_answer_rephrased\": \"HIV prophylaxis encompasses several critical interventions. Consistent and correct condom use during sexual intercourse is essential to mitigate HIV transmission risk. For individuals who engage in intravenous drug use, complete abstinence is advised; however, if drug use occurs, it is imperative to utilize only sterile syringes and water, and to avoid sharing injection paraphernalia. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a preventive measure for individuals at elevated risk of HIV, involving either a daily oral antiretroviral medication or a bimonthly injectable formulation to decrease the likelihood of HIV acquisition via sexual contact or injection drug use. For individuals diagnosed with HIV, adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) as prescribed can suppress viral load to undetectable levels, thereby preventing sexual transmission. To avert vertical transmission, individuals with HIV who adhere to antiretroviral regimens during gestation and delivery can reduce the probability of transmitting the virus to their offspring to less than 1%. Furthermore, in serodiscordant couples, PrEP can offer protection to both the HIV-negative partner and their child during conception, pregnancy, and lactation.\"\n}\n```"
